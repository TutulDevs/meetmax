## Authentication

- There are three forms for sign in, sign up & forgot password
- The apis are in `/src/app/api` folder
- The sign up & forgot password forms call an api on submit
- These apis don't do anyting but send a response
- The sign in form calls api on submit to validate credentials
- A valid email (`u2@yopmail.com`) & password (`Pass.1234`) is being shown in the sign in form for quick sign in
- The valid users are stored in a local file (`/src/mock/users.ts`)
- On a successful sign in, the user will be redirected to home/ feed page & a stringified JS object will be stored in the cookies

## Page protection

- In the middleware file, stringified token is is being stored in a variable
- If there is token, the user is logged in and he/she can't go to any authentication related pages
- If there is no token, the user can't visit the home/ feed page

## Feed page

- The avatar images are from [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)
- The posts data are from a mock file
- In the sidebar, the **Logout** button is functional
-

## TO DOs

- Comments in post
- Set meta title for all pages
- Fetch posts data
- Add loader
- Add error file
